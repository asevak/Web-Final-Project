# My Website
This is the final project that I did while learning web development. 
This project was a great learning experience where I built a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed the layout, made it responsive, and added interactivity to enhance the user experience. Along the way, I learned how to structure web pages, style them effectively, and use GitHub for version control. It also helped me understand debugging and deployment through GitHub Pages. Overall, it was a fun and rewarding project that improved my web development skills! ðŸš€
