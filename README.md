# My Website
This project was an exciting and hands-on experience where I built a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a structured, visually appealing, and interactive web page while implementing best practices in front-end development.

What I Built:
Designed a clean and responsive layout using HTML and CSS, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.
Used CSS Flexbox/Grid to structure elements efficiently and applied animations/transitions to enhance the UI.
Added JavaScript functionality for interactive elements like buttons, form validation, dynamic content updates, and event handling.
Integrated GitHub for version control, tracking changes and collaborating efficiently.

What I Learned:
Responsive Web Design: Ensuring the website adapts to various screen sizes using media queries.
DOM Manipulation in JavaScript: Handling user interactions dynamically.
Debugging & Troubleshooting: Fixing layout issues, browser compatibility problems, and JavaScript errors.
Version Control with Git & GitHub: Managing project versions, pushing updates, and deploying via GitHub Pages.
Optimizing Performance: Reducing page load time by optimizing images, using CSS best practices, and writing efficient JavaScript code.

This project significantly improved my understanding of web development and gave me hands-on experience in structuring, styling, and scripting a website from scratch. It also reinforced my ability to work with GitHub for collaboration and deployment. ðŸš€
